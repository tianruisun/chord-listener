# Tests

One-time setup: `npm install`. The smoke suite uses the installed Google Chrome (or run `npx playwright install chromium` on a PC without Chrome).

| Command | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | every suite against a local copy of this folder |
| `npm test -- --site=https://test.chord-listener.pages.dev` | the smoke suite against the Test site (unit suite still runs on the local code) |
| `npm test -- --site=https://chord-listener.pages.dev` | the same against Production |

Each run prints a count per suite and exits non-zero if anything failed.

| Suite | File | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| unit | `run.js` | chord detection on synthetic audio: single chords, a progression in order, key, capo suggestion, silence |
| smoke | `smoke.js` | page loads with no console errors; fits a 375px phone; TEST badge shows `TEST v<version>` off Production and is absent on Production; offline cache is named after `version.js` |

Screenshots go to `<system temp>/chord-listener-tests/`, never into the repo.
`serve.js` is a tiny static server for local runs; `config.js` holds what differs between repos.
